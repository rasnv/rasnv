# Hi I'm Rama Subramanian V (he/him) ðŸ‘‹

## About Me ðŸ“¢ 

I am a physics graduate who's passionate about exploring planetary surface processes through numerical modeling and data analysis, integrating remote sensing and in-situ data. 

Currently, I am working on shock physics hydrocode numerical models to study the formation of impact craters and impact processes on lunar south polar regions. 

ðŸŒ± I am open to engaging in field and laboratory research, as I believe hands-on expedition and experimentation are critical for conducting geological research.
